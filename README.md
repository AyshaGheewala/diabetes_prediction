# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes based on various health indicators. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and techniques, this model will analyse anonymous health records encompassing parameters such as BMI, age, blood pressure, physical health and dietary habits. By employing feature selection methods and experimenting with various algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests and neural networks, this project seeks to build a robust and accurate predictive tool. 

The ultimate goal is to gain insights into the significant factors contributing to the prediction of diabetes occurrence. Through early detection and intervention, the project aims to contribute to better management and prevention of diabetes, thus improving public health outcomes.
